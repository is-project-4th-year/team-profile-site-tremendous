# Group Portfolio Project

Welcome to the GitHub Essentials Class Group Project!  
In this activity, you'll collaborate in small groups to build a simple group portfolio website while learning essential Git and GitHub practices.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

Each group will work together to create a single `index.html` file.  
Each member will add a section with:

- Their **name**
- Their **area of tech interest**
- An **avatar of an animal** (not part of the Big Five) that represents them, and a short explanation why (wait for instruction to do this)

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Use `git clone`, `branch`, `add`, `commit`, and `push`
- Create meaningful commit messages using [Conventional Commits](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13)
- Create and review **pull requests**
- Resolve merge conflicts
- Create and assign **issues**
- Add milestones
- Collaborate as a team using GitHub effectively

   ```
3. Create a branch using your GitHub username:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```
4. Open `index.html` and add your section
5. Add an image representing your chosen animal and explain your choice
6. Add and commit your changes using the correct convention:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add my section with avatar and explanation

   Added my details to the group portfolio page.

   Footer: #10"
   ```

7. Push your branch:

## 📦 Conventional Commits Guide

Use the following types in your commit messages:

- `feat:` For new features (e.g., adding your section)
- `fix:` For typo/spelling corrections
- `docs:` For editing README or documentation
- `style:` For formatting changes (no logic changes)
- `refactor:` For restructuring HTML/CSS without changing behavior

Always try to include:

- **Header**: Short summary
- **Body** (optional): Why the change was made
- **Footer** (optional): Issue reference
